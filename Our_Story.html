  <h1> Our Story</h1>
  <p><img src="https://images.inc.com/uploaded_files/image/1920x1080/getty_938993594_401542.jpg" alt="Coffee" class="center" > We are three university students who have a passion for coffee and shared love for experimenting with new flavors. We realized that buying coffee every day can become quite expensive therefore we decided to make a website where students can have access to free, easy make-at-home recipes just like the ones you will find in a fancy coffee shop. Our enthusiasm grew as the potential to build a website dedicated to university students and their love for coffee. With a blend of creativity, determination, and caffeine-fueled energy, we embarked on our journey to create the ultimate coffee hub, where the aroma of freshly brewed ideas would waft through the comfort of your home.
